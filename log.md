### Day 1: 8th January, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Lesson Completed: Introduction to HTML.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, I'm just getting back into it after the holiday period. Today I could definitely have coded more. Need to get a good 4 or more hours per day in to really see progress.

### Day 2: 9th January, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Lesson Completed: HTML Document Standards. Project Completed: Fashion Blog. Module Completed: Elements and Structure

**Thoughts** Today's progress was quite a bit more than Wednesday's however, I'm struggling with the decision of which path to explore. HTML & CSS are quite a bit easier for me at the moment but Python and a computer science path may be more valuable in the future.
