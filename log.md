**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 8th January, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Lesson Completed: Introduction to HTML.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, I'm just getting back into it after the holiday period. Today I could definitely have coded more. Need to get a good 4 or more hours per day in to really see progress.

### Day 2: 9th January, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Lesson Completed: HTML Document Standards. Project Completed: Fashion Blog. Module Completed: Elements and Structure

**Thoughts** Today's progress was quite a bit more than Wednesday's however, I'm struggling with the decision of which path to explore. HTML & CSS are quite a bit easier for me at the moment but Python and a computer science path may be more valuable in the future.

### Day 3: 10th January, Friday

**Thoughts** Progress is moving a bit quicker. The past few days have been more recapping items learned in freecodecamp.org but the focus is now on completing the CodeAcademy tutorials and gaining some ground on Web Development track.

### Day 4: 11th January, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Lessons Completed: Navigation of Command Line. Projects Completed: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts, Bicycle World. Modules Completed: Intro to Local Website Development, Command Line for Building Websites. Milestones Completed: How to Build Websites on Your Own Computer.

**Thoughts** Command line stuff was cool to work through just to get a feel for it. I've always had a soft spot for keyboard shortcuts so using the terminal could become the new norm. Figuring out background images in elements was a little process. Turns out all I was missing was one . to go back a directory. If I had done the command line module first this would maybe have been figured out a bit quicker. Also, interesting to compare my html & css to the solutions on Dasmoto's project. My HTML was a bit shorter due to not using DIVs (good or bad?) and CSS was a tiny bit longer.

### Day 5: 13th January, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Lessons Completed: The Box Model, Changing the Box Model, CSS Display and Positioning. Projects Completed: Typography, The Box Model: Davie's Burgers, Broadway. Modules Completed: Learn CSS: Typography, Learn CSS: The Box Model, Display and Positioning. Milestones Completed: Intermediate CSS: Colors and Typography, Intermediate CSS: Layout and Positioning.

**Thoughts** Mostly smooth sailing today, the biggest hiccup was a couple of incorrect answer on the CSS positioning and display quiz. I need to know the values a little bit better and their effects, specifically absolute vs static vs relative.

**Side Note** Sunday had a small bit of coding but was distracted so didn't count it towards 100DaysOfCode.
